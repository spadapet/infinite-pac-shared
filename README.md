This repo contains the full source code for building the game *Infinite Pac Shared*, which is built from the same source code as *Infinite Pac* in the Windows 10 app store. The game *Infinite Pac* is available for free here: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4vbpc

## Starting point
Open the solution game.sln in Visual Studio 2019.

The file App.xaml.cpp in the Maze project is where game initialization starts. The file Main.cpp in the Maze project is where the main() function is, but really game init starts in App.xaml.cpp since Main.cpp is just minimal stuff to get into the App class.
